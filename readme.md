# weewx-wdc-interceptor-docker
This is my own dockerfile, forked from Daveiano! Many thanks to him, as now, I am running the newest versions of [weewx](https://github.com/weewx/weewx) on my synology NAS. I also run the [interceptor](https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-interceptor) driver and following extensions: [weewx-forecast](https://github.com/chaunceygardiner/weewx-forecast/) extension, [weewx-wdc](https://github.com/Daveiano/weewx-wdc), [weewx-xcumulative](https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-xcumulative), [weewx-xaggs](https://github.com/tkeffer/weewx-xaggs),
[weewx-GTS](https://github.com/roe-dl/weewx-GTS).

These are the things I did to get it working:

My weather station (Bresser WIFI 5in1 pro) unfortunately did not allow for a direct connection to a home server, but it does allow for an upload to Wunderground. I created an account, and completed the details and from then onwards, my station is sending data to Wunderground. But, I still wanted to capture the traffic for using in my home assistant. That's why in my ASUS router with Merlin firmware, I created some IP-tables to redirect the traffic to Wunderground to my WeeWx server:

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s bresserIP -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination weewx-serverIP:3010 
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE  

Now all packets will be redirected to port 3010.

Then I installed this docker container on my synology via docker-compose. The interceptor is used in the listen mode. This is the docker-compose file. The tags of the image will change depending on install and use. As you can see, the docker is listening to port 9877, which I redirected to port 3010. There is also on nginx service included, for the website.

```
version: "3.7"

services:
  weewx-python:
    container_name: weewx_bresser
#    build: .
    image: mynygit/weewxv5_docker:5.1.0
    ports:
      - 3010:9877
    volumes:
      - weewx-db:/home/weewx-data/archive
      - weewx-html:/home/weewx-data/public_html
      - /linktomydockerdata/:/home/weewx-data/data
    restart: unless-stopped
  weewx-web:
    container_name: weewx_bresser_web
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - 8014:80
    volumes:
      - weewx-html:/usr/share/nginx/html

volumes:
  weewx-db:
  weewx-html:
```

Then, for the interceptor driver inweewx.conf:

```
[Interceptor]
    # This section is for the network traffic interceptor driver.

    # The driver to use:
    driver = user.interceptor
    device_type = wu-client   #### this is used for all undefined clients which just upload to Wunderground.
    mode = listen
    address = 0.0.0.0
    port = 3010

Hi all

I am enjoying a lot my Bresser Wifi Pro 5in1 weather station and I am pushing the data into my home assistant via the WeeWX docker. I first explain a bit how I did it, as it may help users with similar hardware, but at the end, I do have a question.

These are the things I did to get it working:

My weather station unfortunately did not allow for a direct connection to a home server, but it does allow for an upload to Wunderground. I created an account, and filled out the details and from then onwards, my station is sending data to Wunderground. But, I still wanted to capture the traffic for using in my home assistant. That's why in my ASUS router with Merlin firmware, I created some IP-tables to redirect the traffic to Wunderground to my WeeWx server:
 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s bresserIP -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination weewx-serverIP:3010 
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE  

Now all packets will be redirected to port 3010.

Then I installed a docker container on my synology via docker-compose. The docker is from felddy, weewx. This combines MQTT,  weewx and the interceptor, as I am redirecting traffic.
--------------------------
version: "3.8"
services:
  weewx:
    container_name: weewx_bresser
    image: felddy/weewx
    init: true
    restart: "always"
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host    
    ports:
       - 8102:80
    volumes:
       - /volume1/docker/weewx/:/data
      - /volume1/docker/weewx/html/:/home/weewx/public_html/
    environment:
      - timezone=Europe/Brussels
      - WEEWX_UID=weewx
      - WEEWX_GID=dialout
-------------------
This docker requires in my data folder of course the configuration file. At first install, this file is created, then, you can fill it out. I copy here the most important parts of my weewx.conf.

# weewx-wdc-interceptor-docker - ORIGINAL TEXT, not being used for me.

A simple Dockerfile to run [weewx](https://github.com/weewx/weewx) with the [interceptor](https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-interceptor) driver.
The [weewx-forecast](https://github.com/chaunceygardiner/weewx-forecast/) extension is also installed along with
[weewx-wdc](https://github.com/Daveiano/weewx-wdc), [weewx-xcumulative](https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-xcumulative), [weewx-xaggs](https://github.com/tkeffer/weewx-xaggs),
[weewx-GTS](https://github.com/roe-dl/weewx-GTS), and [weewx-cmon](https://github.com/bellrichm/weewx-cmon).

There are branches available with [weewx-DWD](https://github.com/roe-dl/weewx-DWD), [weewx-mqtt](https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-mqtt) and both extensions together.

WeeWX is installed via the [`pip` installation method](https://www.weewx.com/docs/5.0/quickstarts/pip/).
